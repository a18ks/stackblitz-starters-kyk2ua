          In earlier chapters, we’ve dealt mostly with functional React
          components that do not require state management. This chapter’s main
          focus is on state, its management, and components that utilize it in
          React.

        <h2>What is State?</h2>
        <p>

          component and is controlled solely by the said component...

        <h2>Adding State to a Class Component</h2>

class Greeting extends React.Component {
    render(){
        return &lt;h1&gt;I’m a component in need of some state!&lt;/h1&gt;;
    }
}
            </pre
        >
        <p>
          Adding state to the Greeting component involves defining a constructor
          function...

        <h2>Investigating State using React Dev Tools</h2>

          The devtools are available for download on both Mozilla Firefox
          Add-ons and the Chrome Web Store...
